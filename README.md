# Dictionary-Learning
Overcomplete dictionary for sparse representations. Train and test on images (K-SVD, GenOMP)

Script vectorizes and normalizes images for training.
K-SVD algorithm is used for dictionary learning and GenOMP for finding the sparse representations in respect of the parameter T.
For each epoch, Frobenius norm of error is computed.
You can also see a visualised display of the dictionary.
Testing set contains one image from the training set and some different images.
